# Python Image to 8-Bit Art Converter

This Python program converts images into 8-bit art, providing a simplified "bit art" style for the input images.

## Features

- **Image Conversion:** Converts input images into an 8-bit art style.
- **Customizable Palette:** Allows customization of the number of colors used in the conversion.
- **Simple Usage:** Easy-to-use interface for converting images.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pillow (Python Imaging Library)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NishitKaul/NFT-BitArt_Gen.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install pillow
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the Python script:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2. Enter the path to the image file when prompted.
   {note: it is better to keep the image in the project-folder only, else it'll be hectic to write down the path }

4. The program will convert the image into an 8-bit art style and display the resulting image.

## Configuration

- **Adjusting Color Palette:** Modify the `n_colors` variable in the script to change the number of colors used in the conversion.

## Caution

Generating without saving the previous output somewhere else will override the file
